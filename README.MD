## :loop: Flask Database :loop:
<hr>

This assignment was for practice creating a flask database with a working form to submit. We used SQL Alchemy and SQL Migrate for the database handling. This assignment was a little fustrating because there were a lot of components that I had to keep track of. Even so, I was able to get this flask application to work the way I wanted it to. I liked this project because it was a refresher of what we learned in lecture and it gave me a deeper understanding of the different components that have to be used.
